# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-from-Bangla-Voice

Since the start of civilization, the primary communication way for humans have been the use of speech.  And the most fundamental way in which a person tries to make others understand what he/she is wanting to say  is the use of emotion in his/her speech. In order to make robots and software interactive with their users, emotional recognition of the speech is very important. In the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) field, speech emotion recognition is a very active research topic and has a wide range of applications. In the clinical diagnosis of mental health problems, emotion recognition plays a fundamental role. For distance learning. this technology is used to detect customers’ dissatisfaction in automatic call centers. Among other verticals that can benefit from this technology are automotive and gaming. It can play an important part in security, too. It can identify people in a crowd, and monitor citizens for suspicious behavior by tracking identity, age, gender, and current emotional state. It can be used to pre-emptively stop criminals and potential terrorists. The research of automatic speech emotion recognition, not only can promote the further development of computer technology, but also will greatly enhance the efficiency of people’s work and study, and help people solve their problems more efficiently. It will also further enrich our lives and improve our quality of life.

Many have worked on this topic in recent years in English speech and many English database has been built for speech emotion research. But unfortunately, very little work has been done in the Bengali language. In this project, we have tried to build our own dataset for Bangla emotional speeches and have tried to detect the emotion expressed in them. We tried to implement so by applying machine learning algorithms. We have primarily focused on four emotions- happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality. We have principally used the KNN Classifier to differentiate those four emotions.
